# 🚀 SSSC Coding Challenge 2020 🚀

## 🥳 Introduction

Welcome to the SSSC's 2020 Coding Challenge! Over the next couple of hours, you and a team of 3 other people will try to solve as many of the provided problems as you can. Points will be assigned based off the number of teams that manage to solve each question (see [Scoring](#-scoring) below). The team with the most points at the end of the night wins! 🏆

And don't worry - there will also be a random raffle at the end of the night, so make sure to stay the whole time and try your best!

## ✏️ Instructions

Coding challenges will be added to this repository as teams complete questions.

**PLEASE LET US KNOW WHEN YOU COMPLETE A QUESTION** so that we can release the next challenge!

**PLEASE NOTE**: You *are* allowed to use the Internet 🌏, however you ***WILL*** lose points if you do so 😭. We have 👀's everywhere, so don't try to be sneaky! If caught being sneaky, you will lose extra POINTS! 😒

At the end of the night, we will calculate the number of points each team has earned!

## Downloading the Challenges

1. Open Git Bash (if you don't know what this is, ask an SSSC mentor)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/ScienceStudentSuccessCentre/CodingChallenge2020.git`
3. Navigate into the directory with `cd CodingChallenge2020`
4. Every time we add a new question, run `git pull`

If you need help with anything, please ask an SSSC mentor!

## 💯 Scoring

The number of points each question is worth will be judged based off of the number of teams that solve it. For example:

- 5 teams at the event
- 4 teams solve question 1
- 1 team solves question 2
- Therefore, question 2 is worth more than question 1

If you're really curious, the formula is `(1 - (x / y)) * 10 + 1`.

## 💰 Prizes
